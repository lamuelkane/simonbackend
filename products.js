        name:"Grape   Ape",

        description:`Grape Ape is a tasty, memorable strain with strong indica roots. Its distinctive look and complex fruity flavor makes it an easy favorite — to say nothing of its incredibly potent body high. Grape Ape is the product of strains as different as Mendocino Purps, an award-winning Northern California crossbreed, the influential staple strain Skunk, and a legendary Afghani landrace. The combination of these nuances has yielded a bold and visually striking variety.

        There are different varieties of Grape Ape, with seeds available from Washington State-based Apothecary Genetics and Barney’s Farm, the seed bank responsible for creating other taste-focused strains like LSD and Pineapple Chunk. Testing lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of Grape Ape at between 15% and 25% THC composition.
        
        Grape Ape is marked by standout colors and multi-layered scents — this is strain with more consumer “bag appeal” than most. Buds are large and have a dense bud structure with tightly-curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a deep green, with certain phenotypes expressing shades of purple and even red, with copper-colored pistils throughout. Trichome count varies from moderate to high, leaving the flowers especially sticky. The multicolored leaves are also very pungent: a candy-like grape smell wafts from the chunky buds. Breaking open the sticky flowers with a grinder gives off a different odor, with some skunky musk from the Skunk #1 parent and more of a thick hash scent from Afghani. When inhaled though, the slightly harsh smoke from Grape Ape tastes more fruity than skunky — notes of grape and berries predominate, leaving behind a sweet sensation at the top of the palate.
        
        This strain has a high that mounts slowly, eventually leading to a very weighty sensation in the head and limbs. Because of its slow onset, those enjoying Grape Ape should consume cautiously, keeping in mind that a little of this strain can go a long way. In ideal conditions, Grape Ape provides a palpable sense of both mental and physical relaxation, easing users into a spacey calmness. Rather than stimulating rapid-fire thoughts, Grape Ape offers a full body stone. Like the similarly simian-named hybrid Gorilla Glue, Grape Ape may leave you feeling like a clumsy, sleepy primate. Its indica strength makes Grape Ape a helpful strain for those suffering from nagging pain, whether due to temporary aches or more chronic conditions like fibromyalgia. It can also soothe sore muscles after strenuous exercise. Mentally, this strain can melt stress and anxiety with the force of its foggy high. Definitely an after-dark strain, making it great for inducing sleep.

        description:`ACDC is a sativa-dominant phenotype of the high-CBD cannabis strain, Cannatonic. One remarkable characteristic of ACDC is its THC:CBD ratio of 1:20, meaning this strain induces little to no intoxicating effects. Tests have put ACDC’s CBD content as high as 19%, which helps many patients treat pain, anxiety, epilepsy,
         multiple sclerosis, and the negative effects of chemotherapy, all with a clear head. This strain will have you thunderstruck!

        The smell of ACDC is earthy, sweet, and skunky and some may taste a hint of fruit. When smoking the herb, users may be able to detect the cherry and lemongrass scent better. The buds are tight but fluffy and the color is green with orange hairs. Look for different delivery methods such as capsules, teas, tinctures, and lotions.
        
        Recreational users should pass this one by as its profile is more like hemp. Medical patients, especially those with severe disorders like epilepsy, should definitely try it. Medical conditions that ACDC may alleviate include cancer, alcoholism, seizures, and severe pain. Patients with less severe conditions also use this strain.
        
        Because of its higher CBD content, ACDC might be helpful for edible bakers who want to minimize the risk of intense side effects.
        
        An early study at New York University’s Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center studied a preparation of CBD in an agent called Epidiolex. Investigators found that the drug was safe, well-tolerated, and effective.
        
        Due to the balance in Sativa/Indica, which may edge towards a Sativa, users should feel an uplifting effect including euphoria, peace, and happiness. You may feel more focused and more sociable. Some have described the sensation as completely relaxing without a worry on the horizon.
        
        Growers can expect a bushy plant with thin, feathery leaves that may grow as high as four feet. It looks and grows like a skunk variety with big colas. The leaves may turn a bit purple and the nugs are about the size of a thumb.

        description:`Afghan Kush has roots that trace back to the Hindu Kush mountain range near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There its genotype has been perfected over centuries, making it the ultimate source for hash such as charas and the sticky black Afghani hash. White Label Seed Company, a Sensi Seeds partner from the Netherlands, made the seeds of this strain available for everyone to grow. The buds of this strain develop into massive, blunt-topped nuggets full of resin; pure indica goodness with a heavy yield. Revered for its heavy resin content and powerfully sedating effects, Afghan Kush is a top choice for anyone looking to relax after a long day.

        Due to the heavy Indica effects, it is most often used by insomniacs as a night time medication. It is also used to help people cope with stress and anxiety. People with eating disorders, such as anorexia, use it because of its effect on appetite. Thanks to its heavy body high, it is an ideal strain for pain relief, bringing relaxation to users with chronic pain.
        
        Traditionally, the strain was harvested to produce a very potent hashish – the quality the strain retained. Due to the sturdy nature of this wild strain, it is recommended for amateur growers. Afghan Kush’s unusually high THC content can make up for the lower yields beginners might harvest. It is fairly resistant to disease and molds (another big plus for beginners). Because of its natural hardiness, Afghan Kush can be grown both indoors and out. The strain flowers for seven to eight weeks and is ready for harvest in October when grown outside. Being an Indica, short Afghan Kush plants grow wide, filling out rather than up. A well-grown plant can yield 400 grams per square meter inside or between 500 to 600 grams outside.

Crossing a Blueberry indica with the sativa Haze, it balances full-body relaxation with gentle cerebral invigoration. Novice and veteran consumers alike enjoy the level effects of Blue Dream, which will ease you gently into a calm euphoria. Sometimes this strain will express more indica-like phenotypes with the look and feel, but the sativa-leaning variety remains most prevalent.

        With a sweet berry aroma redolent of its Blueberry parent, this strain delivers swift symptom relief without heavy sedative effects. This makes this a popular daytime medicine for patients treating pain, depression, nausea, and other ailments requiring a high THC strain.
        
        Blue Dream’s high is all the best parts of its parentage wrapped neatly into a flavor-packed, beautifully balanced package. It begins with a cerebral rush, bringing with it motivation and heightened focus, so enjoy this through any jam-packed schedule. As the high builds you fall into an ultra-relaxed state, leaving you feeling hazy and totally calm. This numbing sensation will find you pain-free and ready for any task.
        
        Continuing with the plethora of effects, users who suffer from anxiety disorders are not recommended to use this strain as it has a tendency to get ahead of you quickly and could definitely agitate pre-existing conditions. However, because it is super potent it does have extremely beneficial elements for patients who suffer from chronic fatigue, depression, and lack of appetite. As it is a stimulant at its core, it will undoubtedly lift your mood and get the body moving. It is also recommended for mild cases of muscle spasms and pains caused by injury or illness.

        description:`Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large “mass” of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.

        This strain is most often reserved for evening or night-time use due to its sedating effect. For the same reason, it’s good for insomniacs seeking a full night’s rest. Critical Mass Indica body high may ease most chronic aches and pains as well as relieve stress and anxiety. Others choose this strain for migraines, nausea, and anorexia. The effects usually last between 2-2.5 hours, depending on the dose. Some users find this strain thought-provoking and nearly psychedelic. As nearly all strains with high THC content, this strain when consumed in higher quantities can produce dry mouth and eyes as well as some paranoia and anxiety.
        
        Critical Mass is Mr. Nice’s rework of an older set of genetics called Big Bud. The intention behind the rework was to create a stable strain with a massive yield and a very desirable high. It is a cross between a landrace Afghani Indica and Skunk #1. Despite being susceptible to molds and requiring support to grow properly, it is recommended to novice growers because of its yield and ability to grow indoors or out. Reported yields of up to 6 pounds make this strain ideal for cash-crop growers. The strain flowers between 6 and 8 weeks, and it grows well in the Sea of Green setup.

A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss.

        There are several different phenotypes of the GSC strain including Thin Mint and Platinum Cookies, which exhibit some variation in appearance and effect. Typically, however, GSC expresses its beauty in twisting green calyxes wrapped in purple leaves and fiery orange hairs. Patients and consumers looking to cultivate this cannabis staple themselves should wait 9 to 10 weeks for their indoor plants to finish flowering.
        
        GSC has some incredibly powerful effects that are beneficial to the medical community in numerous ways. First and foremost, this is a great strain for treating chronic pain, inflammation, muscle tension, and cramps. Its highly sedative properties will have you feeling relief in no time.

Green Crack is usually sativa-dominant, but there’s also a less popular indica-heavy version of the strain. Green Crack got its name from Snoop Dogg, though it’s also known as Green Cush or simply Cush among smokers who prefer not to reference cocaine. This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It’s most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It’s most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It’s one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.

        Despite mostly indica physical characteristics, Green Crack has a strong and buzzy sativa high. It provides users with a boost of energy that soon manifests as a cerebral mindset, making this an excellent wake and bake strain. Green Crack’s potency can make mundane like dishes and laundry tasks more interesting. It’s also an inspiring smoke — its sharp sense of focus can help users zero in on creative projects or can draw attention to the nuances in a piece of music or a movie. Green Crack can also have some slightly psychedelic effects, including visual distortions and, particularly, an odd sense of time dilation. Because it can leave users feeling uplifted and fairly wired, this strain isn’t recommended for use late at night. Because it doesn’t have many physically relaxing indica properties, Green Crack doesn’t have a wide range of medical benefits. However, its energizing effects can be great for freeing users from fatigue. Green Crack can also aid those suffering from anxiety and depression, helping them to live in the moment — although in large enough doses, the tendency towards recursive cerebral thinking can plunge some into panic or paranoia.

Juicy Fruit smells and tastes sweet and smooth, and many users describe it tasting like Pina Colada and dark berries or plums. The buds are colorful and may exhibit the entire spectrum of cannabis coloring. Juicy Fruit’s parents are two landraces: a Thailand Sativa and an Indica from Afghanistan.

        Sativa is dominant in Juicy Fruit. It boosts moods, fills users with energy and seems to create a ‘time warp’, slowing the perception of time for the users. The high can last up to three hours and can stimulate focus and creativity. The cerebral effects taper off without leaving users feeling drained. As a result, the strain is often prescribed as daytime relief for depression, stress, and anxiety. A mild body high may also accompany the cerebral effects and can assist in alleviating pain and nausea.
        
        This strain may be hard to grow outdoors, but it thrives indoors or in a greenhouse. Juicy Fruit’s Sativa dominance shines through again as plants can reach up to three meters in height. The strain needs between 50 and 60 days to finish flowering. It can reportedly produce a large yield with up to 20% THC.

Those suffering from stress, anxiety, and depression favor this strain for its mood elevating properties. The strain is also used for the relief of nausea and eating disorders. Lemon Skunk is designed by DNA Genetics, who chose two different strains of skunk with a strong flavor and scent of lemons as its parents. The mother is a skunk that originated from Vegas, while the father came from Holland. The strain grows easily and is suitable to growers with any experience level. It thrives both indoors and out. Needing 55 to 65 days to finish, the strain can reportedly produce up to 600 grams per square meter. Outside, Lemon Skunk is usually ready for harvest in October in the Northern Hemisphere and in April in the Southern. <strong>Effects –&nbsp;</strong>Happy,&nbsp;Uplifted,&nbsp;Euphoric,&nbsp;Relaxed,&nbsp;Creative <strong>Medical Benefits –&nbsp;</strong>Depression,&nbsp;Fatigue,&nbsp;Stress,&nbsp;Pain,&nbsp;Insomnia <strong>Flavours –&nbsp;</strong>Lemon,&nbsp;Skunk,&nbsp;Citrus</p>`,

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express strain</strong>&nbsp;has thick and lumpy buds that show off the strain’s hybridized genetics: they are densely packed like indica flowers, but have the long and tapered shape characteristic of many sativa varieties. The deep green leaves are sometimes tinged with shades of red (the result of pigments activated by cold weather during the grow process) and are accented by deep orange to red pistils. This is a very resinous strain, and the sticky flowers can be very hard to break up without a grinder; the residue left behind may be difficult to clean off of surface and fingertips. The predominant smell of&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;flowers is, unsurprisingly, pineapple — but there are other, less tropical scents present like a hint of musk and some dank earthiness.</p>
        <p>When inhaled, the smooth smoke from this strain tastes earthy and a little bit piney. On the exhale, users will detect a sugary sweetness that lingers in the mouth, although not unpleasantly.</p>
        <p><strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;offers what can be described as a creeper of a high — smokers may have long since finished savoring the smoke’s unique taste before they notice the effects. They begin in the head, with a change in perception. Many have reported some initial psychedelic distortions like a sharpened focus on colors and sounds. As such,&nbsp;<em>Pineapple Express</em>&nbsp;can be a great strain to accompany a scenic walk. This alert head high is soon accompanied by a tingling relaxation in the extremities that helps users feel at ease, whatever their surroundings. The combination of cerebral focus and mellow relaxation makes Pineapple Express a versatile strain, good for chatty get-togethers or getting through a to-do list. Medically, this strain’s feeling of mental calm can be very effective in treating mood and anxiety disorders, helping patients to be more fully present and energetic. And although this strain isn’t as good as some more indica-dominant hybrids in treating physical pain, its head high can actually be useful in distraction users from the acute perception of chronic pain. The high from Pineapple Express is said to last longer than usual, providing a more economically efficient high for many consumers.</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Nuken Strain</strong>&nbsp;is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/ 20% sativa) strain created as cross between the cult favorite God Bud X Kish strains.

The aroma of&nbsp;<em>Nuken</em>&nbsp;is that of a sweet marshmallow with a hint of sharp skunk, and the taste is much like a freshly baked marshmallow pie with a hint of skunk upon exhale.&nbsp;<strong>Nuken</strong>&nbsp;buds have large dense and furry light minty green nugs with a thick layer of dark olive green leaves and sparse fiery orange hairs.</p>

        <p>One of the most notable strains in North America,&nbsp;<strong>OG Kush</strong>&nbsp;embodies the epitome of Californian cannabis. It has become one of the top strains to crossbreed, because of its proven quality and potency. OG Kush is a cross between&nbsp;Chemdawg&nbsp;and Hindu Kush. Chemdawg is a straight-to-the-brain hybrid, while Hindu Kush is a heavy&nbsp;Indica. These two strains would make OG Kush a perfect blend for any cannabis user.</p>
        <p>The buds are covered in trichomes that lend them a silvery-white appearance and make them very sticky to the touch — when prepping buds for a joint or a pipe, users may want to use a grinder. When properly cured, the buds have a earthy, musty scent that is accented by some citrusy brightness: the overall impression is of a hoppy craft beer. Burning or breaking open the buds offers more of a pine-like odor. Smoke from OG Kush is commonly harsh and cough-inducing; it may sting the sinuses and cause eyes to water. The smoke tastes hashy and spicy like a classic indica on the inhale and exhale. OG Kush’s pungent funk may linger for a while after a joint has been extinguished — those looking to remain discreet about their smoking should take the proper precautions.</p>
        <p>The high from OG Kush is more head-focused than physical. It starts with a sudden headrush that may lead users to feel more focused on their surroundings; sounds and colors may seem intensified. This alteration of the senses may soon give way to a general uplift in mood that progresses towards euphoria. The increase in focus is not as cerebral as with more pure sativas — smokers will not suffer from a disorienting sense of rapid thought association or “mindrace.” &nbsp;It’s a versatile smoke that lends itself to the user’s mood and mindset The combination of mental stimulation and improvement in mood makes this a uniquely social strain, good for parties and lively conversations. It’s also a great way to enhance activities that involve the body and mind, like video games, exercise, and even sex. OG Kush has medical application as a means to temporarily relieve anxiety and depression by helping users live in the moment. Its sense of focus can also be helpful for those suffering from attention deficit disorders. Some have reported relief from headaches and migraines with this strain as well. As with many sativa varieties, OG Kush has the potential to make users feel paranoid with higher doses.</p>

        <p>Popularized by&nbsp;Jimi Hendrix’s 1967 classic, Purple Haze delivers a dreamy burst of&nbsp;euphoria&nbsp;that brings veteran consumers back to their psychedelic heyday. This nostalgic&nbsp;sativa&nbsp;staple remains cherished for its&nbsp;high-energy&nbsp;cerebral stimulation that awakens&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;and blissful&nbsp;contentment&nbsp;throughout the day. Purple Haze is believed to have descended from parent strains&nbsp;Purple Thai&nbsp;and&nbsp;Haze, who pass on a mix of&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;and&nbsp;earthy&nbsp;flavors underscored by notes of&nbsp;berry&nbsp;and sharp&nbsp;spice. Following her 8 to 9 week flowering time, Purple Haze buds typically acquire vibrant hues of lavender that further justify the naming of this strain.</p>
        <p>When properly cured, flowers of Purple Haze give off a dank, musty scent. A second whiff reveals some tart, berry-tinged notes. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers releases an herbal aroma, familiar to fans of Haze. Purple Haze gives off a very smooth and easily ingested smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. The smoke tastes sweet and hashy on the exhale. Notably, despite its purple coloring, this strain has no discernible grape flavors; this is because the pigments that determine its color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.</p>
        <p>Purple Haze tends to work its magic soon after users inhale its flavorful smoke. As with many other sativas, this strain goes right to the head, resulting in side effects like a slight pressure around the temples or a flushing in the cheeks. Once these odd sensations abate, though, users are granted access to a higher plane of thinking in which ideas jump around in free association in surprising new connections. Certain thoughts or ideas may strike the consumer as more interesting than they otherwise might — and might not seem particularly engaging to bystanders who aren’t under a similar influence. As such, Purple Haze can stimulate conversation in social settings with like-minded people, serving as an icebreaker even when used among new acquaintances. Those who aren’t overwhelmed by the cerebral energy that Purple Haze provides may also find them able to ease into a heavy workload, whether it’s open-ended and creative or consists of complicated analytical tasks. After some time passes, this strain’s physical side may creep in bit by bit. Rather than relaxing the user and undoing Purple Haze’s buzzy effects, though, this body high is stimulating and somewhat trippy. Smokers may feel a new connection to their body or a new groundedness. This eventual combination of physical and mental qualities makes this bud a great way to enjoy activities that involve both body and mind, like exercising or gaming. Under the right circumstances and with the right company, Purple Haze can even be an effective aphrodisiac. As the high tapers off after a few hours, you may feel your energy begin to dip — but even so, this strain isn’t likely to make you crash and isn’t recommended for consumption before bedtime.</p>

        <p><strong>Trainwreck</strong>&nbsp;is a mind-bending&nbsp;hybrid&nbsp;with potent&nbsp;sativa&nbsp;effects that hit like a freight train.&nbsp;Mexican and&nbsp;Thai&nbsp;sativas were bred with&nbsp;Afghani&nbsp;indicas to produce this Northern California staple, passing on a&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;lemon&nbsp;and&nbsp;spicy&nbsp;pine&nbsp;aroma.&nbsp;<strong>Trainwreck</strong>&nbsp;begins its speedy hurtle through the mind with a surge of&nbsp;euphoria, awakening&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;and&nbsp;happiness.&nbsp;Migraines,&nbsp;pain, and&nbsp;arthritis&nbsp;are mowed down by Trainwreck’s high THC content, and many patients also use it for relief of&nbsp;anxiety,&nbsp;ADD/ADHD, and&nbsp;PTSD. The flowers finish up in early October outdoors, while indoor gardens are ready for harvest 8 weeks into flowering.</p>
        <p>This strain was supposedly the creation of two Californian brothers back in the late 1970s. It is a mix of three other strains Thai (Sativa), Mexican (Sativa) and Afghani (Indica). In its true form, Trainwreck is ninety percent Sativa and only ten percent Indica. As the story goes the two brothers had to pull their crop early because there was a nasty train wreck that happened near their grow site and they didn’t want it discovered,&nbsp;thus the name.</p>
        <p>Trainwreck can grow well both indoors and outdoors. Plants of this strain grow fairly tall but the Indica in them causes them fill out well. Inside grown in hydro a single plant can yield up to 500 grams in a square meter. When grown in soil outside Trainwreck plants are ready for harvesting early October and can yield up to 700 grams. This strain flowers somewhere between eight and ten weeks.</p>
        <p>For the longest time Trainwreck was only available in clone form but more recently a few places have been able to recreate seeds of the strain. There are several others that have tried to imitate the strain under the same name, some with great success. The buds give off a strong citrus smell as they ripen.</p>

        <p><strong>White Russian</strong>&nbsp;is a indica dominant strain which comes from the cross of two legendary strains, white widow and AK-47. This strain won the best overall in 1996 at the high times cannabis cup. This flower is known to leave you stuck on the couch if you over consume.&nbsp;The high from this strain takes hold almost immediately in the form of some initial disorientation and tightening around the temples. Users report feeling quickly energized and motivated, and being able to function with more clarity than confusion. As is characteristic of parent strain White Widow, White Russian has an intensely cerebral high that can lend itself to introspection, lateral thinking for problem solving, and creative inspiration. A sense of euphoria and emotional well-being can accompany this mental stimulation. Despite some indica in its genetics, this strain carries very little physical effects — although, as with any variety of cannabis, heavy consumption can lead to couch lock and drowsiness. White Russian’s powerful head high makes it effective in treating anxiety and depression. It is also particularly beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Red, dry eyes are a common side effect, a result of the high THC in this strain dilating blood vessels and capillaries controlling blood flow to the eyes. Because of its cerebral intensity, White Russian also has the potential to veer into paranoid or anxious territory; users should consider their individual tolerance as well as their mindset and setting before enjoying this strain. More likely to leave you wired than lazy, White Russian is definitely a strain to be enjoyed during the daytime.</p>
        <p>Plants of White Russian may be user-friendly for even novices to grow; the strain’s hearty genetics mean that it is more resistant to adverse growing conditions and not as high-maintenance as many other strains. That said, growing this variety outdoors requires a consistently warm temperature and a direct albeit not overpowering source of sunlight. Plants are relatively short and bushy for a sativa-dominant variety, reaching between 3 and 4 feet tall when grown indoors. Plants also have a low leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning that cultivators won’t need to worry as much about trimming fan leaves during the vegetative state. Grown indoors, plants flower after 8 to 9 weeks. Outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October.</p>

        <p>Cali Connection’s&nbsp;<strong>Jedi Kush Strain</strong>&nbsp;brings together the forces of&nbsp;Death Star&nbsp;and&nbsp;SFV OG&nbsp;Kush, an&nbsp;indica&nbsp;alliance that will awaken both mind and body. Jedi Kush’s timid aroma isn’t fully realized until a bud is cracked open, releasing a complex fusion of sour&nbsp;skunk&nbsp;and tangy&nbsp;diesel. Dreamy&nbsp;euphoria&nbsp;blankets the mind, a sensation that builds over time into bolting cerebral&nbsp;energy&nbsp;that’s unexpected from our&nbsp;indicas. This lethargy-free strain is a great way for patients to get a powerful dose of&nbsp;cannabinoids&nbsp;during the day while treating ailments like&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;PTSD,&nbsp;depression,&nbsp;stress,&nbsp;headaches, and&nbsp;appetite loss. Jedi plants&nbsp;show resilience in outdoor gardens but also thrive indoors with a flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">When properly cured, flowers of Jedi Kush carry the prominent scent of diesel fumes — this aroma was likely passed on from parent strain Death Star, which has Sour Diesel in its background. On closer inspection, the buds also have a damp, earthy scent, somewhat like of moist soil after a rainstorm. Grinding up or breaking open these buds yields sharp, skunky notes. When combusted, Jedi Kush burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the palate and sinuses, causing coughing and watery eyes. Those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to take a few precautions, as this strain can be a particularly pungent smoke.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Jedi Kush offers a slow, creeping high. It may be several minutes after smokers have enjoyed its complex flavor combination before they begin to feel a gradual warping of their sensory perception. Sights and sounds may take on a new dimension; users also describe a powerful sense of time dilation. Once consumers acclimate, though, they can point this high in any direction they might want. It can inspire creativity as well as deep analysis for work on problem-oriented tasks. Alternatively, Jedi Kush can be great for spacing out and daydreaming while enjoying one’s surroundings. In addition to these cerebral vibes, a slight, tingling body high leaves smokers with newfound energy and motivation — this combination of mental and physical effects is great for activities that involve both, like exercise, dancing, and even sex. Although it’s largely not sleepy, increasing dosage can eventually bring about couchlock. Jedi</p>

        <p>The heritage of the&nbsp;<strong>Pink Kush</strong>&nbsp;<strong>strain</strong>&nbsp;is a little uncertain, but it’s known to be a relative and possibly an offspring of the legendary&nbsp;<em>OG Kush</em>, one of history’s most popular indica strains.&nbsp;<em>Pink Kush</em>&nbsp;carries on the legacy, delivering a potent body high that’s very effective as medical treatment. The effects are calming and intensely euphoric, with happiness and a powerful case of the munchies. It’s a versatile tool for treating anxiety, depression, inflammation, lack of appetite, migraines and other headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and insomnia. The sativa/indica ratio of this strain is hard to verify, but appears to be as low as 10:90, meaning strong physical effects.</p>
        <p>THC tests are scarce, but the few that are publicly available suggest fairly high potency, topping 20%. CBD levels are reportedly much lower, less than 1%, so this isn’t an ideal choice for treating conditions that respond to that chemical, including epileptic disorders. The flavor and aroma of&nbsp;<strong>Pink Kush</strong>&nbsp;are similar, with notes of pine, wood, and flowers. The strain gets its name in part from the pink hairs that punctuate its green nugs. It’s most popular on the legal markets of the Pacific Northwest and Canada.</p>
        <p>Medical patients tend to gravitate toward Pink Kush for its overwhelming body effects that work to combat physical pain, migraines, and nausea. Used frequently to overcome stress, anxiety, and extreme nervousness, it’s a great way to calm yourself down and enjoy a carefree day. If used later in the evening, smoking a decent amount of this strain will lull you into a deep sleep.</p>
        <p>As if it couldn’t get any better, Pink Kush is also pretty easy to grow, with plants that produce high yields and are resistant to common molds. The only potential complaint about this gal is that it takes 10 to 11 weeks for her to flower, which for some people can feel like an eternity. Cultivate Pink Kush inside or outdoors for a strain that’s robust and great smelling.</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sour Diesel Strain</strong>, sometimes called Sour D, is an invigorating sativa-dominant strain&nbsp;named after its&nbsp;pungent,&nbsp;diesel-like aroma. This fast-acting strain delivers&nbsp;energizing, dreamy cerebral effects that have pushed Sour Diesel to its legendary status.&nbsp;Stress,&nbsp;pain, and&nbsp;depression&nbsp;fade away in long-lasting relief that makes&nbsp;<em>Sour Diesel</em>&nbsp;a top choice among medical patients. This strain&nbsp;took root in the early 90’s, and it is believed to have descended from&nbsp;Chemdawg 91&nbsp;and&nbsp;Super Skunk.</p>
        <p><strong>Sour Diesel</strong>&nbsp;has round, medium-sized buds with leaves that appear yellowish-green. Red hairs called pistils, structures that operate to catch pollen from male plants, contrast with the densely-packed leaves. When properly cured, the flowers are somewhat sticky — the dusting of trichomes is not as immediately obvious as it is on more resinous strains like&nbsp;White Widow. Nevertheless, breaking open buds reveals trichomes coating the insides of the dense flowers. The buds have an overpowering smell that, true to this strain’s name, is very similar to gasoline. The odor also has some hints of orange. Breaking open or grinding the buds intensifies this scent, and adds components of musk and pine sap. Sour Diesel has a notoriously harsh, acrid smoke that can cause users to cough or make their sinuses water. The smoke has a sour and vaguely skunky taste that may describe as unpleasant; on the exhale, the diesel and almost ammonia-like tang stings the palate and may linger for a long time afterward. Smokers trying to remain discreet should be warned that this is a very pungent strain whose odor can carry for quite a distance.</p>

        <p><strong>Wedding Cake</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;hybrid&nbsp;with indica-dominance. It is attained by crossing triangle cookies x animal mints. It gives an exceptionally sweet aromatic essence and a fruity flavour. The taste is a perfect combination of sweetness of&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;and fruitiness of a cherry pie. It works as a calming agent and appetite stimulator, and is quite helpful for patients who experience regular depression-associated syndromes, fibromyalgia, MS and other such related symptoms. It may act as a sedative for patients, but does help in calming down nerves or controlling anxiety stimulating symptoms. Although it might not completely hamper your focus and energy levels, it will cause the usual drying out of eyes and mouth.&nbsp;<em>Wedding Cake</em>&nbsp;particular&nbsp;medical marijuana&nbsp;is grown indoors. It is observed to contain a THC level of 14-18% and a CBD level of 0.23%. In terms of physical features, it is shaped like pine trees and looks dense in its structural form. It is quite frosty looking and has dark green leaves. This particular medical marijuana is also thickly dressed up with orange hair all over it. It is most generally known for its sugary taste, as well as high potency value.</p>
        <p>This strain’s high starts relatively quickly, taking hold primarily in the head. Users may find their thoughts to be more fast-paced or intense, and may perceive their surroundings more acutely. In the right set and setting, this change in thinking is accompanied by feelings of giddiness or euphoria. Less than an hour into the high, Wedding Cake’s indica side kicks in. Smokers might feel increased warmth and a pleasant heaviness that spreads through the spine and limbs. Even in the midst of this sedation, though, cerebral stimulation continues, allowing users to feel uniquely “tuned in” to their surroundings. This holistic combination of mental and physical effects lends itself to complex activities like creating art, exercising, and even sex. As the high progresses, so does this strain’s body high — after a few bowls, smokers may find themselves couchlocked.</p>
        <p>Wedding Cake may also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to bring about feelings of perceptiveness can aid those with mild to moderate stress, anxiety, and depression, helping them feel more “in the moment.” Because this strain leaves users lucid and levelheaded, it can also help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on specific tasks. Wedding Cake’s gradual waves of physical relaxation can soothe both temporary and chronic aches and pains and, in high enough doses, can bring about relief for insomnia. Finally, it can be a potent appetite stimulant for those who have lost their hunger to disease, medication, or chemotherapy.</p>

        <p><strong>Park Place Pineapple Shatter</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<em>Pennybags Extracts</em>&nbsp;is an extract from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://buylowgreen.com/product/pineapple-express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pineapple Express</a></strong><a href="https://buylowgreen.com/product/pineapple-express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a><strong><a href="https://buylowgreen.com/product/pineapple-express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strain</a>.&nbsp;</strong>It&nbsp;combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strains<em>&nbsp;Trainwreck</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Hawaiian</em>. The smell is likened to fresh apple and mango, with a taste of pineapple, pine, and cedar. This hard-hitting sativa provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes.</p>
        <p><strong>The Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Strain</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>Sativa</strong>&nbsp;dominant strain with a 60:40&nbsp;<strong>sativa</strong>/<strong>indica</strong>&nbsp;ratio. The strain is quite popular and has achieved recognition thanks to the stoner film of the same name. However, you have to keep in mind that the strain is not as intense as the movie has made it out to be. But&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;still manages to offer a mild and nice body-numbing buzz, which is something to look forward to. The&nbsp;<strong>strain</strong>&nbsp;is offered in the form of well-weighed nuggets that look like Styrofoam popcorn. It does not taste sweet, but it does smell funky with its citrus overtones. The taste is quite extraordinary with a hint of pineapple while you inhale. Pineapple Express is chosen to treat a lot of medical problems including anxiety and stress. However, it is even more effective at curing the symptoms of chronic depression at the same time. If you are suffering from mild pains and aches, you should look no further. After a smoke, you will realize&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;is calming and stimulating at the same time. Not only will it heighten all your senses but you will feel energized all the while observing an increase in focus, awareness and creativity.</p>

        <p>If you are a fan of Star Trek then you’ve heard of&nbsp;<strong>Pennybags Extracts</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Railroad</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Romulan Shatter</strong>. That’s exactly where this potent strain got its name from. Jokingly people said this bud would dent your head, and to this day the legend lives on.</p>
        <p>For those who look to credentials to verify a strains status and worth, look no further. Known for its pine scented buds that are packed with frosty goodness. A perennial High Times Magazine and Cannabis Culture staple, the&nbsp;<em>Romulan strain</em>&nbsp;has garnered the respect of peers from all corners of the planet.</p>
        <p>Romulan’s exact roots are somewhat of a mystery. Federation Seeds purchased the strain in 96′ and attempted to keep the strain alive by cloning it with White Rhino and back crossed it until only 3% White Rhino was remaining.</p>
        <p>A very heavy Indica that doesn’t mess around,&nbsp;<strong>Romulan weed</strong>&nbsp;isn’t for the faint of heart. Its extremely heavy stone leaves patients with the “couch lock” feeling whether they desire it or not. This is a strain most definitely not recommended for day time consumption. Unless you’re looking for a solid day time nap of course, then be our guest. Starting off with a very euphoric and uplifting high, you will soon realize that your hunger is unbearable and eating the entire fridge is a must, pronto.</p>
        <p>Due to its powerful numbing effects,&nbsp;<a href="https://buylowgreen.com/product/romulan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Romulan</em>&nbsp;</a>is also exceptionally good at ridding your body of pains and aches. For those dealing with muscle and nerve damage that leads to spastic movements are also directed to this flower. Start slow as this is a potent strain that packs a powerful punch. We recommend starting with only a couple puffs and working your way up slowly.</p>

        <p>Crafted from the genetics of&nbsp;God Bud,&nbsp;<strong>Quadzilla Shatter</strong>&nbsp;is a mostly&nbsp;indica&nbsp;strain bred by Caña de España specifically for hot climates. Crushing&nbsp;euphoria and&nbsp;sedation&nbsp;are delivered alongside a sour&nbsp;berry&nbsp;flavor accented with subtle notes of&nbsp;vanilla. Thoughts wander away, taking with them&nbsp;stress,&nbsp;anxiety, and&nbsp;depression. After some time, Godzilla’s effects subside to clear headed, functional&nbsp;bliss. Patients treating&nbsp;pain&nbsp;and&nbsp;muscle spasms&nbsp;may find relief in Godzilla’s potent and tranquilizing onset. Following a 55 day flowering cycle indoors or at the end of September outdoors, this indica produces colorfully vibrant buds of green and purple hues.</p>

The medicinal benefits are great for treating symptoms of chronic pain, sleep disorders, cancer and epilepsy.

With a&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;and&nbsp;earthy&nbsp;aroma, the&nbsp;<strong>Girl Scout Cookies strain</strong>&nbsp;launches you to&nbsp;euphoria’s top floor where full-body&nbsp;relaxation&nbsp;meets a time-bending cerebral space. A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;nausea, and&nbsp;appetite loss.</p>
        <p>There are several different&nbsp;phenotypes&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>GSC</em>&nbsp;strain including&nbsp;Thin Mint&nbsp;and&nbsp;Platinum Cookies, which exhibit some variation in appearance and effect. Typically, however,&nbsp;<strong>GSC</strong>&nbsp;expresses its beauty in twisting green&nbsp;calyxes&nbsp;wrapped in purple leaves and fiery orange hairs. Patients and consumers looking to cultivate this cannabis staple themselves should wait 9 to 10 weeks for their indoor plants to finish flowering.</p>
        <p>GSC has some incredibly powerful effects that are beneficial to the medical community in numerous ways. First and foremost, this is a great strain for treating chronic pain, inflammation, muscle tension, and cramps. Its highly sedative properties will have you feeling relief in no time. Additionally, many use this strain as a stress reliever. The tranquilizer-like feeling of this bud puts you in a place of complete relaxation, slaying stress and even getting you ready for a good night’s sleep.</p>

        <p>Girl Scout Cookies Moonrocks is an indica-dominant hybrided product with a strong sativa component (40:60 sativa/indica ratio). This product can reach THC levels of up to 57.2%, meaning it’s one of the most potent moonrocks available to medical marijuana patients. This product provides the best aspects of both sativa and indica, and the high is powerful, happy, and euphoric, but with couch-lock body effects and feelings of lethargy. Girl Scout Cookies moonrocks tastes sweet and earthy, and it smells much the same.</p>
        <p>Benefits Of Girls Scout Cookies Moonrocks</p>
        <p>Relieves Anxiety &amp; Stress<br>
        One of the most popular and well-known uses of Cannabis Essential Oil is to get relief from stress and anxiety. The natural compounds found in this oil, including the famed THC, which is what gives cannabis the distinction of a drug in many countries, are very good for releasing pleasure hormones and relaxing the mind, reducing stress and inducing a sense of calmness and relaxation.</p>
        <p>Promotes Good Sleep<br>
        For people who suffer from insomnia, constant anxiety during the night, or simply struggle to get a sound, restful night of undisturbed sleep, Cannabis Essential Oil works like a charm. By relaxing the body and mind, and inducing a lower energy level, it will be easier to get your heart rate down and clear your head before a long night of peaceful slumber.</p>
        <p>Appetite Booster<br>
        It is well known that people who consume cannabis in other forms notice increased appetite, famously called “the munchies”. However, Cannabis Essential Oil can help regulate your appetite and induce hunger, while also stimulating your digestive system to operate at a regular level. This can help people who want to gain weight quickly, particularly after an extended illness or injury recovery.</p>
        <p>Pain Reliever<br>
        Cannabis Essential Oil works as a great pain reliever and is regularly suggested for people with inflammation, chronic pain, and even emergency pain relief. There is a very good reason why people who suffer from cancer often turn to cannabis-related options, including Cannabis Essential Oil, when the pain of chemotherapy or the disease itself becomes unbearable.</p>

It’s also an inspiring smoke — its sharp sense of focus can help users zero in on creative projects or can draw attention to the nuances in a piece of music or a movie. Green Crack moonrocks can also have some slightly psychedelic effects, including visual distortions and, particularly, an odd sense of time dilation. Because it can leave users feeling uplifted and fairly wired, this moonrock isn’t recommended for use late at night. Because it doesn’t have many physically relaxing indica properties, Green Crack moonrocks doesn’t have a wide range of medical benefits. However, its energizing effects can be great for freeing users from fatigue. Green Crack can also aid those suffering from anxiety and depression, helping them to live in the moment — although in large enough doses, the tendency towards recursive cerebral thinking can plunge some into panic or paranoia.</p>
        <p>Green Crack moonrocks is more likely to make users energized and inspired than strung out and manic. Providing the best of what sativa varieties have to offer, it’s a great moonrock for enhancing your appreciation of your surroundings or simply as a way to help you get up and go. It’s also unique in its potency — even for more experienced cannabis fans, a little bit of this controlled substance can go a long way.</p>

        <p><strong>Juicy Fruit</strong>&nbsp;is the original name of Sensi Seeds, being a&nbsp;sativa-dominant&nbsp;hybrid that they now call Fruity Juice, perhaps to avoid trademark infringement. Juicy Fruit smells and tastes sweet and smooth, and many users describe it tasting like Pina Colada and dark berries or plums. The buds are colorful and may exhibit the entire spectrum of cannabis coloring. Juicy Fruit’s parents are two landraces: a Thailand Sativa and an Indica from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Sativa is dominant in Juicy Fruit. It boosts moods, fills users with energy and seems to create a ‘time warp’,&nbsp;slowing the perception of time for the users. The high can last up to three hours and can stimulate focus and creativity. The cerebral effects taper off without leaving users feeling drained. As a result, the strain is often prescribed as daytime relief for depression, stress, and anxiety. A mild body high may also accompany the cerebral effects and can assist in alleviating pain and nausea.</p>
        <p>This strain may be hard to grow outdoors, but it thrives indoors or in a greenhouse.&nbsp;Juicy Fruit’s Sativa dominance shines through again as plants can reach up to three meters in height. The strain needs between 50 and 60 days to finish flowering. It can reportedly produce a large yield with up to 20% THC.</p>

        <p><strong>Lemon Skunk</strong>&nbsp;is an award-winning Sativa hybrid, known for its lemon flavor and a THC count as high as 22%. It made the High Times list of top 10 strains in 2009.The aroma is Skunky and sweet while the flavor is reminiscent of sweet lemons and other citrus fruit. Lemon Skunk delivers a heady, peppy cerebral high that comes with a boost of energy and creativity, a dose of happiness, and a euphoric kick. It’s an uplifting yet lazy experience. The sativa genes offer effective treatment for depression, nausea, chronic pain, and everyday stresses. CBD levels are a bit higher than average in this strain, roughly 0.5% in some tests, but not high enough to recommend it as treatment for conditions that respond to CBD, such as epilepsy. Dry mouth and watery eyes are the only widely reported negative effects of Lemon Skunk, though paranoia, anxiety, and dizziness are also possible. Found up and down the West Coast, this strain is also popular in Colorado. It occasionally circulates on the black market, as well. Lemon Skunk performs well when used for daytime pain relief, especially in the case&nbsp;of chronic migraines, and&nbsp;is most often prescribed for this purpose. Those suffering from stress, anxiety, and depression favor this strain for its mood elevating properties. The strain is also used for the relief of nausea and eating disorders. Lemon Skunk is designed by DNA Genetics, who chose two different strains of skunk with a strong flavor and scent of lemons as its parents. The mother is a skunk that originated from Vegas, while the father came from Holland. The strain grows easily and is suitable to growers with any experience level. It thrives both indoors and out. Needing 55 to 65 days to finish, the strain can reportedly produce up to 600 grams per square meter. Outside, Lemon Skunk is usually ready for harvest in October in the Northern Hemisphere and in April in the Southern. <strong>Effects –&nbsp;</strong>Happy,&nbsp;Uplifted,&nbsp;Euphoric,&nbsp;Relaxed,&nbsp;Creative <strong>Medical Benefits –&nbsp;</strong>Depression,&nbsp;Fatigue,&nbsp;Stress,&nbsp;Pain,&nbsp;Insomnia <strong>Flavours –&nbsp;</strong>Lemon,&nbsp;Skunk,&nbsp;Citrus</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>White Widow Strain</strong>&nbsp;is a hybrid strain that many have been familiar with since the early 90’s. This strain has global popularity and can easily be found atop a menu at almost any Amsterdam coffee shop. The prevalence of&nbsp;<em>White Widow</em>&nbsp;has greatly increased due to the television show Weeds and references within the rap industry. This strain holds a pretty balanced 60:40 sativa/indica ratio ( Brazil Sativa x South Indian Indica) that leads one to a cognitive driven high with a relaxing undertone.</p>
        <p>Patients will opt for the&nbsp;<em>White Widow strain</em>&nbsp;if they’re seeking a strain that allows them to unwind and relax while still maintaining a sense of mental awareness. This strain is especially good for depression, stress, pain, and PTSD. White Widow gets its name from the fact that it is literally blanketed in white crystals. Beware though, this sweet sugary smoke starts out light but expands dramatically which can lead to heavy coughing; especially if you’re a novice smoker. When it comes to smell, you can expect a citrus and peppery scent that is accompanied by a lemony aftertaste. This strain is perfect for outdoor activities like hanging out at the beach or taking a nice walk.</p>
        <p>White Widow can be grown from seed or from clone (achieved by planting clippings of mature and healthy plants). It is a mold-resistant strain, making outdoor cultivation an option — although an almost Mediterranean climate with constant temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit works best. Despite a mostly sativa high, White Widow look much more indica during the vegetative stage: plants are bushy and wide, and rarely exceed 6 feet in height. The plants flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect about 37 to 55 grams (or about 1.3 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant.</p>

        <p><strong>Grape Ape</strong>&nbsp;is a tasty, memorable strain with strong indica roots. Its distinctive look and complex fruity flavor makes it an easy favorite — to say nothing of its incredibly potent body high. Grape Ape is the product of strains as different as Mendocino Purps, an award-winning Northern California crossbreed, the influential staple strain Skunk, and a legendary Afghani landrace. The combination of these nuances has yielded a bold and visually striking variety.</p>
        <p>There are different varieties of Grape Ape, with seeds available from Washington State-based Apothecary Genetics and Barney’s Farm, the seed bank responsible for creating other taste-focused strains like&nbsp;LSD&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pineapple Chunk. Testing lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of&nbsp;<strong>Grape Ape</strong>&nbsp;at between 15% and 25% THC composition.</p>
        <p>Grape Ape is marked by standout colors and multi-layered scents — this is strain with more consumer “bag appeal” than most. Buds are large and have a dense bud structure with tightly-curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a deep green, with certain phenotypes expressing shades of purple and even red, with copper-colored pistils throughout. Trichome count varies from moderate to high, leaving the flowers especially sticky. The multicolored leaves are also very pungent: a candy-like grape smell wafts from the chunky buds. Breaking open the sticky flowers with a grinder gives off a different odor, with some skunky musk from the Skunk #1 parent and more of a thick hash scent from Afghani. When inhaled though, the slightly harsh smoke from Grape Ape tastes more fruity than skunky — notes of grape and berries predominate, leaving behind a sweet sensation at the top of the palate.</p>
        <p>This strain has a high that mounts slowly, eventually leading to a very weighty sensation in the head and limbs. Because of its slow onset, those enjoying Grape Ape should consume cautiously, keeping in mind that a little of this strain can go a long way. In ideal conditions, Grape Ape provides a palpable sense of both mental and physical relaxation, easing users into a spacey calmness. Rather than stimulating rapid-fire thoughts, Grape Ape offers a full body stone. Like the similarly simian-named hybrid&nbsp;Gorilla Glue, Grape Ape may leave you feeling like a clumsy, sleepy primate. Its indica strength makes Grape Ape a helpful strain for those suffering from nagging pain, whether due to temporary aches or more chronic conditions like fibromyalgia. It can also soothe sore muscles after strenuous exercise. Mentally, this strain can melt stress and anxiety with the force of its foggy high. Definitely an after-dark strain, making it great for inducing sleep.</p>

        <p><strong>Afghan Kush</strong>&nbsp;has&nbsp;roots that trace back to the&nbsp;<strong>Hindu Kush</strong>&nbsp;mountain range near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There&nbsp;its genotype has been perfected over centuries,&nbsp;making&nbsp;it the ultimate source for&nbsp;<strong>hash</strong>&nbsp;such as charas and the sticky&nbsp;<strong>black Afghani hash</strong>. White Label Seed Company, a Sensi Seeds partner from the Netherlands, made the seeds of this&nbsp;<strong>strain</strong>&nbsp;available for everyone to grow. The buds of this strain&nbsp;develop into massive, blunt-topped nuggets full of resin; pure&nbsp;<strong>indica</strong>&nbsp;goodness with a heavy yield. Revered for its heavy resin content and powerfully sedating effects,<strong>&nbsp;Afghan Kush</strong>&nbsp;is a top choice for anyone looking to relax after a long day.</p>
        <p>Due to the heavy Indica effects,&nbsp;it is most often used by insomniacs as a&nbsp;night time medication.&nbsp;It is also used to help people cope with&nbsp;stress and anxiety. People with eating disorders, such as anorexia, use it because of its effect on appetite. Thanks to its heavy body high, it is an ideal&nbsp;strain for pain relief,&nbsp;bringing relaxation to users with chronic pain.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the strain was harvested&nbsp;to produce a very potent hashish –&nbsp;the quality the strain retained. Due to the sturdy nature of this wild strain, it is recommended for amateur growers. Afghan Kush’s unusually high THC content can make up for the lower yields beginners might harvest. It is fairly resistant to disease and molds (another big plus for beginners). Because of its natural hardiness, Afghan Kush can be grown both indoors and out. The strain flowers for seven to eight weeks and is ready for harvest in October when grown outside. Being an Indica, short Afghan Kush plants grow wide, filling out rather than up. A well-grown plant can yield 400 grams per square meter inside or between 500 to 600 grams outside.</p>

        <p><strong>Critical Mass</strong>&nbsp;is a combination of&nbsp;Afghani&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skunk&nbsp;#1&nbsp;that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large “mass” of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this&nbsp;strain&nbsp;is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.</p>
        <p>This strain is most often reserved for evening or night-time use due to its sedating effect. For the same reason, it’s good for insomniacs seeking a full night’s rest. Critical Mass Indica body high may ease most chronic aches and pains as well as relieve stress and anxiety. Others choose this strain for migraines, nausea, and anorexia. The effects usually last between 2-2.5 hours, depending on the dose. Some users find this strain thought-provoking and nearly psychedelic. As nearly all strains with high THC content, this strain when consumed in higher quantities can produce dry mouth and eyes as well as some paranoia and anxiety.</p>
        <p>Critical Mass is Mr. Nice’s rework of an older set of genetics called Big Bud. The intention behind the rework was to create a stable strain with a massive yield and a very desirable high. It is a cross between a landrace Afghani Indica and&nbsp;Skunk #1. Despite being susceptible to molds and requiring support to grow properly, it is recommended to novice growers because of its yield and ability to grow indoors or out. Reported yields of up to 6 pounds make this strain ideal for cash-crop growers. The strain flowers between 6 and 8 weeks, and it grows well in the Sea of Green setup.</p>

        <p>Cali Connection’s&nbsp;<strong>Jedi Kush Strain</strong>&nbsp;brings together the forces of&nbsp;Death Star&nbsp;and&nbsp;SFV OG&nbsp;Kush, an&nbsp;indica&nbsp;alliance that will awaken both mind and body. Jedi Kush’s timid aroma isn’t fully realized until a bud is cracked open, releasing a complex fusion of sour&nbsp;skunk&nbsp;and tangy&nbsp;diesel. Dreamy&nbsp;euphoria&nbsp;blankets the mind, a sensation that builds over time into bolting cerebral&nbsp;energy&nbsp;that’s unexpected from our&nbsp;indicas. This lethargy-free strain is a great way for patients to get a powerful dose of&nbsp;cannabinoids&nbsp;during the day while treating ailments like&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;PTSD,&nbsp;depression,&nbsp;stress,&nbsp;headaches, and&nbsp;appetite loss. Jedi plants&nbsp;show resilience in outdoor gardens but also thrive indoors with a flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">When properly cured, flowers of Jedi Kush carry the prominent scent of diesel fumes — this aroma was likely passed on from parent strain Death Star, which has Sour Diesel in its background. On closer inspection, the buds also have a damp, earthy scent, somewhat like of moist soil after a rainstorm. Grinding up or breaking open these buds yields sharp, skunky notes. When combusted, Jedi Kush burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the palate and sinuses, causing coughing and watery eyes. Those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to take a few precautions, as this strain can be a particularly pungent smoke.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Jedi Kush offers a slow, creeping high. It may be several minutes after smokers have enjoyed its complex flavor combination before they begin to feel a gradual warping of their sensory perception. Sights and sounds may take on a new dimension; users also describe a powerful sense of time dilation. Once consumers acclimate, though, they can point this high in any direction they might want. It can inspire creativity as well as deep analysis for work on problem-oriented tasks. Alternatively, Jedi Kush can be great for spacing out and daydreaming while enjoying one’s surroundings. In addition to these cerebral vibes, a slight, tingling body high leaves smokers with newfound energy and motivation — this combination of mental and physical effects is great for activities that involve both, like exercise, dancing, and even sex. Although it’s largely not sleepy, increasing dosage can eventually bring about couchlock. Jedi</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express strain</strong>&nbsp;has thick and lumpy buds that show off the strain’s hybridized genetics: they are densely packed like indica flowers, but have the long and tapered shape characteristic of many sativa varieties. The deep green leaves are sometimes tinged with shades of red (the result of pigments activated by cold weather during the grow process) and are accented by deep orange to red pistils. This is a very resinous strain, and the sticky flowers can be very hard to break up without a grinder; the residue left behind may be difficult to clean off of surface and fingertips. The predominant smell of&nbsp;<strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;flowers is, unsurprisingly, pineapple — but there are other, less tropical scents present like a hint of musk and some dank earthiness.</p>
        <p>When inhaled, the smooth smoke from this strain tastes earthy and a little bit piney. On the exhale, users will detect a sugary sweetness that lingers in the mouth, although not unpleasantly.</p>
        <p><strong>Pineapple Express</strong>&nbsp;offers what can be described as a creeper of a high — smokers may have long since finished savoring the smoke’s unique taste before they notice the effects. They begin in the head, with a change in perception. Many have reported some initial psychedelic distortions like a sharpened focus on colors and sounds. As such,&nbsp;<em>Pineapple Express</em>&nbsp;can be a great strain to accompany a scenic walk. This alert head high is soon accompanied by a tingling relaxation in the extremities that helps users feel at ease, whatever their surroundings. The combination of cerebral focus and mellow relaxation makes Pineapple Express a versatile strain, good for chatty get-togethers or getting through a to-do list. Medically, this strain’s feeling of mental calm can be very effective in treating mood and anxiety disorders, helping patients to be more fully present and energetic. And although this strain isn’t as good as some more indica-dominant hybrids in treating physical pain, its head high can actually be useful in distraction users from the acute perception of chronic pain. The high from Pineapple Express is said to last longer than usual, providing a more economically efficient high for many consumers.</p>

        <p><strong>Afghan Kush</strong>&nbsp;has&nbsp;roots that trace back to the&nbsp;<strong>Hindu Kush</strong>&nbsp;mountain range near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There&nbsp;its genotype has been perfected over centuries,&nbsp;making&nbsp;it the ultimate source for&nbsp;<strong>hash</strong>&nbsp;such as charas and the sticky&nbsp;<strong>black Afghani hash</strong>. White Label Seed Company, a Sensi Seeds partner from the Netherlands, made the seeds of this&nbsp;<strong>strain</strong>&nbsp;available for everyone to grow. The buds of this strain&nbsp;develop into massive, blunt-topped nuggets full of resin; pure&nbsp;<strong>indica</strong>&nbsp;goodness with a heavy yield. Revered for its heavy resin content and powerfully sedating effects,<strong>&nbsp;Afghan Kush</strong>&nbsp;is a top choice for anyone looking to relax after a long day.</p>
        <p>Due to the heavy Indica effects,&nbsp;it is most often used by insomniacs as a&nbsp;night time medication.&nbsp;It is also used to help people cope with&nbsp;stress and anxiety. People with eating disorders, such as anorexia, use it because of its effect on appetite. Thanks to its heavy body high, it is an ideal&nbsp;strain for pain relief,&nbsp;bringing relaxation to users with chronic pain.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the strain was harvested&nbsp; to produce a very potent hashish –&nbsp;the quality the strain retained. Due to the sturdy nature of this wild strain, it is recommended for amateur growers. Afghan Kush’s unusually high THC content can make up for the lower yields beginners might harvest. It is fairly resistant to disease and molds (another big plus for beginners). Because of its natural hardiness, Afghan Kush can be grown both indoors and out. The strain flowers for seven to eight weeks and is ready for harvest in October when grown outside. Being an Indica, short Afghan Kush plants grow wide, filling out rather than up. A well-grown plant can yield 400 grams per square meter inside or between 500 to 600 grams outside.</p>

        <p>One of the most notable strains in North America,&nbsp;<strong>OG Kush</strong>&nbsp;embodies the epitome of Californian cannabis. It has become one of the top strains to crossbreed, because of its proven quality and potency. OG Kush is a cross between&nbsp;Chemdawg&nbsp;and Hindu Kush. Chemdawg is a straight-to-the-brain hybrid, while Hindu Kush is a heavy&nbsp;Indica. These two strains would make OG Kush a perfect blend for any cannabis user.</p>
        <p>The buds are covered in trichomes that lend them a silvery-white appearance and make them very sticky to the touch — when prepping buds for a joint or a pipe, users may want to use a grinder. When properly cured, the buds have a earthy, musty scent that is accented by some citrusy brightness: the overall impression is of a hoppy craft beer. Burning or breaking open the buds offers more of a pine-like odor. Smoke from OG Kush is commonly harsh and cough-inducing; it may sting the sinuses and cause eyes to water. The smoke tastes hashy and spicy like a classic indica on the inhale and exhale. OG Kush’s pungent funk may linger for a while after a joint has been extinguished — those looking to remain discreet about their smoking should take the proper precautions.</p>
        <p>The high from OG Kush is more head-focused than physical. It starts with a sudden headrush that may lead users to feel more focused on their surroundings; sounds and colors may seem intensified. This alteration of the senses may soon give way to a general uplift in mood that progresses towards euphoria. The increase in focus is not as cerebral as with more pure sativas — smokers will not suffer from a disorienting sense of rapid thought association or “mindrace.” &nbsp;It’s a versatile smoke that lends itself to the user’s mood and mindset The combination of mental stimulation and improvement in mood makes this a uniquely social strain, good for parties and lively conversations. It’s also a great way to enhance activities that involve the body and mind, like video games, exercise, and even sex. OG Kush has medical application as a means to temporarily relieve anxiety and depression by helping users live in the moment. Its sense of focus can also be helpful for those suffering from attention deficit disorders. Some have reported relief from headaches and migraines with this strain as well. As with many sativa varieties, OG Kush has the potential to make users feel paranoid with higher doses.</p>

        <p><strong>Wedding Cake</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;hybrid&nbsp;with indica-dominance. It is attained by crossing triangle cookies x animal mints. It gives an exceptionally sweet aromatic essence and a fruity flavour. The taste is a perfect combination of sweetness of&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;and fruitiness of a cherry pie. It works as a calming agent and appetite stimulator, and is quite helpful for patients who experience regular depression-associated syndromes, fibromyalgia, MS and other such related symptoms. It may act as a sedative for patients, but does help in calming down nerves or controlling anxiety stimulating symptoms. Although it might not completely hamper your focus and energy levels, it will cause the usual drying out of eyes and mouth.&nbsp;<em>Wedding Cake</em>&nbsp;particular&nbsp;medical marijuana&nbsp;is grown indoors. It is observed to contain a THC level of 14-18% and a CBD level of 0.23%. In terms of physical features, it is shaped like pine trees and looks dense in its structural form. It is quite frosty looking and has dark green leaves. This particular medical marijuana is also thickly dressed up with orange hair all over it. It is most generally known for its sugary taste, as well as high potency value.</p>
        <p>This strain’s high starts relatively quickly, taking hold primarily in the head. Users may find their thoughts to be more fast-paced or intense, and may perceive their surroundings more acutely. In the right set and setting, this change in thinking is accompanied by feelings of giddiness or euphoria. Less than an hour into the high, Wedding Cake’s indica side kicks in. Smokers might feel increased warmth and a pleasant heaviness that spreads through the spine and limbs. Even in the midst of this sedation, though, cerebral stimulation continues, allowing users to feel uniquely “tuned in” to their surroundings. This holistic combination of mental and physical effects lends itself to complex activities like creating art, exercising, and even sex. As the high progresses, so does this strain’s body high — after a few bowls, smokers may find themselves couchlocked.</p>
        <p>Wedding Cake may also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to bring about feelings of perceptiveness can aid those with mild to moderate stress, anxiety, and depression, helping them feel more “in the moment.” Because this strain leaves users lucid and levelheaded, it can also help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on specific tasks. Wedding Cake’s gradual waves of physical relaxation can soothe both temporary and chronic aches and pains and, in high enough doses, can bring about relief for insomnia. Finally, it can be a potent appetite stimulant for those who have lost their hunger to disease, medication, or chemotherapy.</p>

        <p><strong>White Russian</strong>&nbsp;is a indica dominant strain which comes from the cross of two legendary strains, white widow and AK-47. This strain won the best overall in 1996 at the high times cannabis cup. This flower is known to leave you stuck on the couch if you over consume.&nbsp;The high from this strain takes hold almost immediately in the form of some initial disorientation and tightening around the temples. Users report feeling quickly energized and motivated, and being able to function with more clarity than confusion. As is characteristic of parent strain White Widow, White Russian has an intensely cerebral high that can lend itself to introspection, lateral thinking for problem solving, and creative inspiration. A sense of euphoria and emotional well-being can accompany this mental stimulation. Despite some indica in its genetics, this strain carries very little physical effects — although, as with any variety of cannabis, heavy consumption can lead to couch lock and drowsiness. White Russian’s powerful head high makes it effective in treating anxiety and depression. It is also particularly beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Red, dry eyes are a common side effect, a result of the high THC in this strain dilating blood vessels and capillaries controlling blood flow to the eyes. Because of its cerebral intensity, White Russian also has the potential to veer into paranoid or anxious territory; users should consider their individual tolerance as well as their mindset and setting before enjoying this strain. More likely to leave you wired than lazy, White Russian is definitely a strain to be enjoyed during the daytime.</p>
        <p>Plants of White Russian may be user-friendly for even novices to grow; the strain’s hearty genetics mean that it is more resistant to adverse growing conditions and not as high-maintenance as many other strains. That said, growing this variety outdoors requires a consistently warm temperature and a direct albeit not overpowering source of sunlight. Plants are relatively short and bushy for a sativa-dominant variety, reaching between 3 and 4 feet tall when grown indoors. Plants also have a low leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning that cultivators won’t need to worry as much about trimming fan leaves during the vegetative state. Grown indoors, plants flower after 8 to 9 weeks. Outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October.</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sour Diesel Strain</strong>, sometimes called Sour D, is an invigorating sativa-dominant strain&nbsp;named after its&nbsp;pungent,&nbsp;diesel-like aroma. This fast-acting strain delivers&nbsp;energizing, dreamy cerebral effects that have pushed Sour Diesel to its legendary status.&nbsp;Stress,&nbsp;pain, and&nbsp;depression&nbsp;fade away in long-lasting relief that makes&nbsp;<em>Sour Diesel</em>&nbsp;a top choice among medical patients. This strain&nbsp;took root in the early 90’s, and it is believed to have descended from&nbsp;Chemdawg 91&nbsp;and&nbsp;Super Skunk.</p>
        <p><strong>Sour Diesel</strong>&nbsp;has round, medium-sized buds with leaves that appear yellowish-green. Red hairs called pistils, structures that operate to catch pollen from male plants, contrast with the densely-packed leaves. When properly cured, the flowers are somewhat sticky — the dusting of trichomes is not as immediately obvious as it is on more resinous strains like&nbsp;White Widow. Nevertheless, breaking open buds reveals trichomes coating the insides of the dense flowers. The buds have an overpowering smell that, true to this strain’s name, is very similar to gasoline. The odor also has some hints of orange. Breaking open or grinding the buds intensifies this scent, and adds components of musk and pine sap. Sour Diesel has a notoriously harsh, acrid smoke that can cause users to cough or make their sinuses water. The smoke has a sour and vaguely skunky taste that may describe as unpleasant; on the exhale, the diesel and almost ammonia-like tang stings the palate and may linger for a long time afterward. Smokers trying to remain discreet should be warned that this is a very pungent strain whose odor can carry for quite a distance.</p>

        <p>Popularized by&nbsp;Jimi Hendrix’s 1967 classic, Purple Haze delivers a dreamy burst of&nbsp;euphoria&nbsp;that brings veteran consumers back to their psychedelic heyday. This nostalgic&nbsp;sativa&nbsp;staple remains cherished for its&nbsp;high-energy&nbsp;cerebral stimulation that awakens&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;and blissful&nbsp;contentment&nbsp;throughout the day. Purple Haze is believed to have descended from parent strains&nbsp;Purple Thai&nbsp;and&nbsp;Haze, who pass on a mix of&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;and&nbsp;earthy&nbsp;flavors underscored by notes of&nbsp;berry&nbsp;and sharp&nbsp;spice. Following her 8 to 9 week flowering time, Purple Haze buds typically acquire vibrant hues of lavender that further justify the naming of this strain.</p>
        <p>When properly cured, flowers of Purple Haze give off a dank, musty scent. A second whiff reveals some tart, berry-tinged notes. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers releases an herbal aroma, familiar to fans of Haze. Purple Haze gives off a very smooth and easily ingested smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. The smoke tastes sweet and hashy on the exhale. Notably, despite its purple coloring, this strain has no discernible grape flavors; this is because the pigments that determine its color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.</p>
        <p>Purple Haze tends to work its magic soon after users inhale its flavorful smoke. As with many other sativas, this strain goes right to the head, resulting in side effects like a slight pressure around the temples or a flushing in the cheeks. Once these odd sensations abate, though, users are granted access to a higher plane of thinking in which ideas jump around in free association in surprising new connections. Certain thoughts or ideas may strike the consumer as more interesting than they otherwise might — and might not seem particularly engaging to bystanders who aren’t under a similar influence. As such, Purple Haze can stimulate conversation in social settings with like-minded people, serving as an icebreaker even when used among new acquaintances. Those who aren’t overwhelmed by the cerebral energy that Purple Haze provides may also find them able to ease into a heavy workload, whether it’s open-ended and creative or consists of complicated analytical tasks. After some time passes, this strain’s physical side may creep in bit by bit. Rather than relaxing the user and undoing Purple Haze’s buzzy effects, though, this body high is stimulating and somewhat trippy. Smokers may feel a new connection to their body or a new groundedness. This eventual combination of physical and mental qualities makes this bud a great way to enjoy activities that involve both body and mind, like exercising or gaming. Under the right circumstances and with the right company, Purple Haze can even be an effective aphrodisiac. As the high tapers off after a few hours, you may feel your energy begin to dip — but even so, this strain isn’t likely to make you crash and isn’t recommended for consumption before bedtime.</p>

        <p>A perennial favorite,&nbsp;<strong>Green Crack</strong>&nbsp;is a sativa-dominant hybrid that was bred by inbreeding Skunk #1. Green Crack is usually sativa-dominant, but there’s also a less popular indica-heavy version of the strain. Green Crack got its name from Snoop Dogg, though it’s also known as Green Cush or simply Cush among smokers who prefer not to reference cocaine. This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It’s most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It’s most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It’s one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.</p>
        <p>Despite mostly indica physical characteristics, Green Crack has a strong and buzzy sativa high.&nbsp;It provides users with a boost of energy that soon manifests as a cerebral mindset, making this an excellent wake and bake strain. Green Crack’s potency can make mundane like dishes and laundry tasks more interesting. It’s also an inspiring smoke — its sharp sense of focus can help users zero in on creative projects or can draw attention to the nuances in a piece of music or a movie. Green Crack can also have some slightly psychedelic effects, including visual distortions and, particularly, an odd sense of time dilation. Because it can leave users feeling uplifted and fairly wired, this strain isn’t recommended for use late at night. Because it doesn’t have many physically relaxing indica properties, Green Crack doesn’t have a wide range of medical benefits. However, its energizing effects can be great for freeing users from fatigue. Green Crack can also aid those suffering from anxiety and depression, helping them to live in the moment — although in large enough doses, the tendency towards recursive cerebral thinking can plunge some into panic or paranoia.</p>

        <p>Blue Dream, a sativa-dominant&nbsp;hybrid originating in California, has achieved legendary status among West Coast strains. Crossing a&nbsp;Blueberry&nbsp;indica&nbsp;with the&nbsp;sativa&nbsp;Haze, it balances full-body&nbsp;relaxation&nbsp;with gentle cerebral invigoration. Novice and veteran consumers alike enjoy the level effects of Blue Dream, which will&nbsp;ease you gently into a calm&nbsp;euphoria. Sometimes this strain will express more indica-like phenotypes with the look and feel, but the sativa-leaning variety remains most prevalent.</p>
        <p>With a&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;berry&nbsp;aroma redolent of its Blueberry parent, this strain delivers swift symptom relief without heavy sedative effects. This makes this a popular daytime medicine for patients treating&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;depression,&nbsp;nausea, and other ailments requiring a&nbsp;high THC strain.</p>
        <p>Blue Dream’s high is all the best parts of its parentage wrapped neatly into a flavor-packed, beautifully balanced package. It begins with a cerebral rush, bringing with it motivation and heightened focus, so enjoy this through any jam-packed schedule. As the high builds you fall into an ultra-relaxed state, leaving you feeling hazy and totally calm. This numbing sensation will find you pain-free and ready for any task.</p>
        <p>Continuing with the plethora of effects, users who suffer from anxiety disorders are not recommended to use this strain as it has a tendency to get ahead of you quickly and could definitely agitate pre-existing conditions. However, because it is super potent it does have extremely beneficial elements for patients who suffer from chronic fatigue, depression, and lack of appetite. As it is a stimulant at its core, it will undoubtedly lift your mood and get the body moving. It is also recommended for mild cases of muscle spasms and pains caused by injury or illness.</p>

        <p><strong>Mexican Cubensis</strong>&nbsp;Magic Mushrooms have been around for a long time, over 2000 years ago they were used by the Aztecs. These&nbsp;<strong>magic mushrooms</strong>&nbsp;offer users a mild experience, making it great for beginners. The effects given from Mexican Cubensis include happiness and euphoria that will take over your body and mind. Except a boost of creativity which will flow through your mind giving you psychedelic imaginations.&nbsp;You’ll get visuals hallucinations, both with opened and closed eyes: shapes colours variations, as well as fractals and forms.</p>
        <p>Everyone’s physiology and metabolism is different, and individual brain chemistry and body size play a significant role in how each individual might respond to psilocybin, as will your surroundings and emotional state, so if it is your first time or you are significantly upping your dosage, select a safe, comfortable, and if possible, familiar place, and consider asking a sober trip sitter to be your companion for the coming ride.</p>
        <p>At doses over 2 grams, some users report experiencing warping of the visual field, and Dali-esque melting objects. Other possible effects include time distortion, hallucinations both when eyes are closed or open and synesthesia (i.e. “seeing” sounds and “feeling” colours), particularly with the Transkei variety of cubensis, which also tends to have a heavier body load. Remember to stay hydrated, especially if you’re outdoors or doing an activity like dancing. Try sipping some honey ginger tea to counteract any possible nausea during the come-up.</p>
        <p><strong>Dosage Guide:</strong></p>
        <p>Mild Experience: 1 Gram to 1.5 Grams</p>
        <p>Medium Experience: 2 Grams to 3 Grams</p>
